      <description>&lt;p&gt;Phillip Marlowe is a computer engineer with a strong foundation in digital design and physical implementation, recently graduating from UC Santa Cruz with a master’s degree in Computer Engineering. He has developed a semi-general physical design flow focused on the back end, originally intended for RTL generated by PRGA, but flexible enough to accommodate any RTL on any PDK supported by Cadence physical design tools. His flow enables pushing FPGA CLBs, tiles, and complete eFPGA architectures all the way from RTL to GDSII, bridging the gap between high-level design and manufacturable layouts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
