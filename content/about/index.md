I'm an electronics engineer with a strong foundation in digital design and physical implementation, recently graduating from UC Santa Cruz with a master's degree in Computer Engineering. My work centered around a semi-general physical design flow, developed by my colleagues and I, originally intended for RTL generated by PRGA, but flexible enough to accommodate any RTL on any PDK supported by Cadence physical design tools. Our flow enables pushing FPGA CLBs, tiles, and complete eFPGA architectures all the way from RTL to GDSII, bridging the gap between high-level design and manufacturable layouts.

My work sits at the intersection of automation, customization, and hardware design, giving designers a more streamlined path from architecture to silicon. I'm particularly interested in making complex ASIC/FPGA back-end flows more configurable and reusable across different technologies and design targets.

Outside of engineering, I'm a passionate electric bass guitar player and live music lover, drawn to the richness of pure analog sound and the electronics that shape and guide it through amplifiers eventually for our ears to consume. I build and refine my own gear, from graduate level wiring and shielding to simple, custom-designed PCB effects pedals; combining my love of music with my expertise in hardware to craft unique and well designed experiences.
