      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Semi General Physical Design Flow for eFPGA RTL&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;During my masters, I&amp;rsquo;ve developed a semi-general, semi-automated physical design flow for ASIC/FPGA that has been used to produce multiple real designs, including an N8 K4 4×4 FPGA, an N2 K4 8×8 FPGA, and several smaller blocks such as individual FPGA tiles, CLBs, and buffer chains. All of these designs are implemented using open-source process design kits (PDKs). The primary target has been the ASAP7 PDK from ASU, while the FreePDK45 (Free45nm) from NC State has been used to produce a CLB in an alternative process node. This project focuses on building a reusable, configurable back-end flow that can take FPGA-style RTL through to layout on modern open PDKs, enabling rapid experimentation with different architectures and technology nodes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
