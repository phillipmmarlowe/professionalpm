Phillip Marlowe is an electronics engineer with a strong foundation in digital design and physical implementation, recently graduating from UC Santa Cruz with a master’s degree in Computer Engineering. He has developed a semi-general physical design flow focused on the back end, originally intended for RTL generated by PRGA, but flexible enough to accommodate any RTL on any PDK supported by Cadence physical design tools. His flow enables pushing FPGA CLBs, tiles, and complete eFPGA architectures all the way from RTL to GDSII, bridging the gap between high-level design and manufacturable layouts.

Phillip’s work sits at the intersection of automation, customization, and hardware design, giving designers a more streamlined path from architecture to silicon. He’s particularly interested in making complex ASIC/FPGA back-end flows more configurable and reusable across different technologies and design targets.

Outside of engineering, Phillip is passionate about electronic bass guitar and live music, drawn to the richness of pure analog sound and the electronics that shape it. He builds and refines his own gear, from graduate level wiring and shielding to simple, custom-designed PCB effects pedals; combining his love of music with his expertise in hardware to craft unique and well designed experiences.
