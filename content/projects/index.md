**Semi General Physical Design Flow for eFPGA RTL**: 

During my masters, I've developed a semi-general, semi-automated physical design flow for ASIC/FPGA that has been used to produce multiple real designs, including an N8 K4 4×4 FPGA, an N2 K4 8×8 FPGA, and several smaller blocks such as individual FPGA tiles, CLBs, and buffer chains. All of these designs are implemented using open-source process design kits (PDKs). The primary target has been the ASAP7 PDK from ASU, while the FreePDK45 (Free45nm) from NC State has been used to produce a CLB in an alternative process node. This project focuses on building a reusable, configurable back-end flow that can take FPGA-style RTL through to layout on modern open PDKs, enabling rapid experimentation with different architectures and technology nodes.

**D Flip Flop (or std cell) SPICE Simulation Enviroment**: 

I built a SPICE simulation enviroment using Xyce as the SPICE simulator and PySpice to generate SPICE as well as stimuli. The simulation records output voltages/currents of particular ports on an ASAP7 D Flip Flop std cell. Other standard cells can be used in this enviroment as well, with some edits. Other PDKs can be used as well, again with some minor edits. Below is the final graph outputted by the enviroment.

I refined the clk2q delay graphs generated by my D Flip Flop simulation environment by converting the y-axis to a ratio for improved clarity, enhancing the data production and capture process, and optimizing text size and graph resolution for better readability.
